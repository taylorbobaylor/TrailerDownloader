# Testing Strategy for TrailerDownloader Refactor

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the TrailerDownloader application, which has been refactored to use .NET 8 and a React frontend. The testing approach is comprehensive, covering unit tests for the backend and frontend components to ensure functionality and performance.

## Backend Testing
The backend API, developed with .NET 8, is tested using xUnit and WireMock.Net to mock HTTP responses from the TMDB API.

### Unit Tests
- **TMDBClient Tests**: Validates the functionality of the TMDBClient class, ensuring that API calls are constructed and executed correctly, and that the responses are handled as expected.
  - `TestMethod1`: Placeholder for future tests. This method will test the TMDBClient's ability to retrieve movie details from the TMDB API.

### Integration Tests
- **API Endpoint Tests**: Ensures that the API endpoints return the correct status codes and data structures when hit with various requests.
  - *To be implemented*: Tests will simulate real-world scenarios, such as retrieving a list of movies, fetching movie details, and downloading trailers.

### Test Environment
- The tests are run in an isolated environment that does not interact with the live TMDB API.
- WireMock.Net is used to mock the TMDB API responses, allowing for controlled and predictable testing.

### Running the Tests
- To run the backend tests, navigate to the `TrailerDownloader.Tests.Fresh` directory and execute the `dotnet test` command.

## Frontend Testing
The frontend, developed with React, is tested using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Unit Tests
- **Component Tests**: Validates the rendering and functionality of individual components.
  - *To be implemented*: Tests will check if components render without errors and if the UI elements respond to user interactions as expected.

### Integration Tests
- **App Tests**: Ensures that the entire application works together as expected, including state management and API integration.
  - *To be implemented*: Tests will simulate user navigation through the app and interaction with the movie search and download features.

### Test Environment
- The tests are run in a simulated browser environment provided by Jest.

### Running the Tests
- To run the frontend tests, navigate to the `clientapp` directory and execute the `npm test` command.

## Documentation
- All tests include inline comments explaining their purpose and expected outcomes.
- Additional documentation is provided in the codebase to explain the testing approach and setup.

## Future Considerations
- Continuous Integration (CI) setup to run tests automatically on code pushes and pull requests.
- Expansion of test coverage to include more edge cases and error handling scenarios.
- Performance testing to ensure the application scales well under load.
